description: <b>The classic genre-defining whodunit, by the mother of the detective
  novel </b> <br></br><br></br> Introducing the first American series detective, Ebenezer
  Gryce, <i>The Leavenworth Case</i> was published nine years before the debut of
  Sherlock Holmes, and made author Anna Katharine Green an enormously popular and
  influential writer who changed the mystery genre forever. Showcasing Green's verve
  and style, <i>The Leavenworth Case</i> opens with the shocking murder of Horatio
  Leavenworth, a wealthy New York merchant, philanthropist, and well-known member
  of the community. His favorite niece, Mary, is to inherit his fortune, and all of
  the evidence seems to implicate her or her sister. Yet surprises greet Gryce at
  every turn-even before the second murder.
